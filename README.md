This repository contains code samples and techniques referenced in my Medium blog post, ["Delegates in C#"](https://medium.com/@jepozdemir/delegates-in-c-155f062d0f6d). This post and repository focus on understanding delegates in C#, their significance in programming, and practical usage.

## Overview
In this blog post, I discuss delegates, that allows methods to be passed as parameters, enabling flexible and dynamic method invocation.

### Topics Covered

- **What Are Delegates?**  
  An introduction to delegates and how they act as type-safe function pointers.

- **Creating and Using Delegates**  
  Detailed explanation of how to declare, instantiate, and invoke delegates with examples.

- **Multicast Delegates**  
  Discussion on multicast delegates, which can reference multiple methods and how to handle them.

- **Built-in Delegates**
